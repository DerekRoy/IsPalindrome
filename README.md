# IsPalindrome
This program was created to see if it was possible using python to check if a word is a palindrome without using a function to reverse a string. It was accomplished by first setting the variable of palindrome equal to false. By setting the variable to false, we are able to create a condition in which it is true with a for loop. Using a for loop, we are able to set the variable of palindrome equal to true on the condition that the first letter is equal to the last letter of the word, while any other condition allows the variable to still be equal to false. This distinction between true and false allows for an if statement to be made in regards to printing a response to the user. Proving that one can create a program to check if a word is a palindrome without a function predetermined to flipping a string.
